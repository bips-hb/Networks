# Networks

Just to test some basic functions from packages huge, flare, JGL and fastclime

```R
install.packages(c("flare", "JGL", "huge", "fastclime"))
```

If you go through all the code in "methods.R" you will see the basic usage of every algorithm for all these packages.

In a seperate file "TCGA_network.R" the methods from flare and huge are used on gen data from a database. Espescially the select/criterion function is displayed.
